    The title of the painting is related to the fact that this work was actually completed at 6 a.m. with the first rays of the rising sun. I was thinking about a meeting with the client regarding the concept of an architectural project, which contradicted all previous agreements. At this meeting, I had to change the client’s mind. I hadn’t slept for two days, was in a terrible physical and emotional state, and started painting a still life to calm myself down.

    Gradually, the still life turned into a landscape inspired by the work of William Turner. For me, Turner is the father of laconism. With his academic education and technique, he broke all the laws of aerial perspective that existed at the time. For example, the further away an object is, the more blue you need to make it, because the density of the atmosphere colours all distant objects. Turner used other techniques: scale, foreground and background detail, and so on.

    Turner’s work challenged the traditional ideas about painting, just as I was about to challenge the client’s idea about the project. The two monsters on the left and right represent the future of the day that is coming. And in the centre is an image of Marilyn Monroe in the clouds.

    This depicts the consultation process that usually takes place during construction. Three parties are always involved in the process: the customer, the contractor, and the author, which is me.
      
    In the upper right corner is the general contractor, and below him is his entourage. On the left are the client’s representatives. And there is a huge gap between us. The green ones are worms that crawl into your nose and fuck with your brain, causing bleeding.
      
    You can see what a bottomless chasm separates us, how far apart our desires and goals are. There is a complete misunderstanding, some otherworldly forces are affecting the brains of the customer and the contractor. It is a two-legged evil that tries to ruin everything and mix all the colours into mud.

    Dusk is a very subtle state of illumination when, unlike being in complete darkness, we can still see objects, but unlike our perception in bright light, they begin to fade away.
      
    This is a period of equilibrium in illumination, when the real and the imaginary begin to merge. The dark forces have not yet appeared, the light ones have not yet departed. Mystery. It is unknown what is there in the black, it is unknown what is there in the white. The state of fading light and approaching darkness is mesmerising.

    This is a work that was rewritten in 2020—2021, originally titled ‘Fear’ and created in 2016—2019.

    After revision, it became a completely different work. Here, I used a new technique and a new brush to make the image more vivid, and increased the size of the work. 

    The image of the iron man was inspired by the film ‘Iron Man’ on the one hand, and Robert Fripp’s music on the other. The main idea is a face smelted from a piece of iron.

    This is an example of how changing the colour balance and colour temperature changes the image. In traditional painting, such a change would require repainting the entire picture. In digital format, you don’t repaint, but capture these states, fix them and save them. And then you can use them for various purposes, including animation.

    An interesting point: according to all the rules of painting, the foreground and centre should be very detailed and sharp, while the background is usually blurred. In ‘The Race’, it’s the opposite: the centre is blurred, and the edges are very clear. Because of this, it flies out of the plane. It’s in front, and everything else is behind it. It's amazing to see it in motion.

The overwhelming sensation is impossible to describe in words. It is a sharp change in temperature, a transition from one state to another, a leap into the unknown.

    Back then we built shelters and huts, made of branches and twigs. This was our first experience of construction.

    The basis of any work of art is some kind of natural phenomenon. The first drops of rain are like an overture in symphonic music or a preface in a literary work.

    Then the rain intensifies, lightning and thunder are like a crescendo, the revelation of the theme. Hail is a serious revelation of the theme.

    Then it all ends and is replaced by a rainbow — calm, joy... And then ozone. Ozone is also a natural phenomenon, purification.

    These amplitudes — from the quietest to the loudest — are sinusoidal. They are present in our lives and are recorded in our subconscious.

    Children’s perception is generally very abstract. From birth, we have an abstract perception of any object. How else can you explain a child taking two sticks, tying them together and saying that it is an aeroplane, imagining himself as a pilot inside that aeroplane?

    This always exists in our subconscious. And evoking these feelings is a great art.

    To transfer an image from the screen to a flat surface, you need an intermediary: a printer. But every printer has its problem areas. They all usually reproduce the orange-red spectrum beautifully, but problems arise with green and blue, where limitations become apparent.

    A lot of work still needs to be done to achieve a result that is very close to what you see on the screen. A printer cannot fully reproduce the subtlest shades of colour; there will always be some loss, so you have to do tests. And there can be an infinite number of these tests until you, as the author, empirically achieve the closest possible result.

At that moment, they are true abstractionists because they are depicting the surrounding reality in abstract symbols. For us, these are scribbles, but for them, they are very specific things.

    Those scribbles, which encode the surrounding world and which have been ingrained in us since childhood, evoke images from our subconscious, expressed in non-objective painting. Moreover, some people will see one set of images, while others will see another. That is why I find non-objective art more complex and interesting.

    For me, drawing is the basis of all design.

    The training of our generation of architects was based largely on artistic training. We were required to produce 10 pencil sketches from life every day. During the holidays, we had to prepare more than 30 studies in watercolour, tempera and oil. This was done in order to develop the motor skills between the head, i.e. between what you have in mind, and the hand, which instantly translates the idea onto paper in the form of a finished sketch or drawing in the correct proportions.

    We studied all the technical skills — glazing, hatching, watercolour and oil painting, sculpture, nude drawing, geometric and colour still lifes. With this training, some of us became artists, some went into teaching, and some remained faithful to architecture.

    One of the most abstract forms of art is music. I love working while listening to music, especially ‘King Crimson’, Robert Fripp, and Brian Eno. It gives me strength.

    My working day, with its endless phone calls and meetings, ends at 11 p.m., and until morning is the only time I can paint. Music gives me a new burst of energy. You enter an infinite space of musical forms and compositions that stimulate the creation of visual characters and images.

    Art is a mystery.

    The main purpose of art is to evoke emotion. All of life is emotions, both positive and negative. Hidden emotions give rise to stress, which later turns into a storm. But a storm cannot occur or last forever. It is replaced by silence.

    The feeling itself is not infinite, but the change between these states is infinite.

    Transferring a digital image onto a flat surface is a very complex and delicate task. I use Innova IFA-15 single-sided non-woven canvas as the surface. This is English museum-grade paper. The front surface is 100% cotton, and the base is cellulose, i.e. ordinary paper.

    The canvas has a very porous texture, does not yellow and does not deform over time. When printing on such a surface, we obtain a ‘velvety glow’ effect for all colours.

    Painting — is the communication of imagery through the application of paint to a surface. Once we omit the workmanship aspect from our definitions:

    Painting — is the outburst of an artist’s emotions onto a two dimensional plane.

    Sculpture — is the outburst of an artist’s emotions onto a three dimensional form.

    Architecture — is the outburst of an architect’s emotions onto the walls that form space.

    There is a difference in the perception and transmission of colour in digital format, when light comes from inside the screen towards you, and in physical format, when you make a print on paper, when the light falls in the opposite direction — from above onto the image.
    
    Often, additional work is required in dark tones, as the gradations of dark, dense tones are disrupted. Everything may stick together and turn out simply black, and important details will not be drawn.

    Another important difference between digital images and traditional painting is that we can easily change the colour range, which in most cases also changes the images. The same storyline can exist in different colour schemes.
    
    Firstly, this allows us to decorate a modern interior more accurately. Secondly, there are works that are symmetrical and the image hardly changes, only its state changes.
    
    In some paintings, this range is very small. They change slightly in colour ratio, but change significantly in terms of imagery.
