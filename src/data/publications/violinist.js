    We are interviewing Ivan in Moscow’s main postal building — ‘Pochta Rossii’ or ‘Post of Russia’, situated on the Varshavskoye highway. Due to lockdown, there have been difficulties with purchasing furniture, accessories, various servicing parts and even simple LEDs. Ivan needs very specific types of lamps, to create the right lighting conditions within his interiors, so he is forced to order them online. The customs section within this large building is not the best place to conduct an interview; but this location also gives us an advantage, as we are able to find out a lot more detail about routine tasks, characteristic to Ivan’s profession. We talk about custom architectural projects in general and then switch to specific recent works.

    BREAK DOWN WALLS

    ‘Ghost’ is not the first villa that Ivan has designed and built for the same client. ‘It’s probably the 6th one’ he says, appearing to have lost count. Their working relationship began with a simple consultation about a kitchen within a property that was already in the final stages of its construction. Despite the fact that the windows had already been installed, this consultation ended with three quarters of the property demolished, redesigned and rebuilt. ‘After that I have built another few houses for them. It’s their style. They like to build a villa, stay in it for a few years, sell it on, and then build a new one. This is the ideal client. They hardly ever interfere with the creative process and the most important thing is that they are not afraid to take risks if I offer new ideas. It’s interesting to work with them. Although sometimes they too start to ‘tighten the screws’. When this happens, the answer is simple, but effective ‘I will never create anything substandard, so if you want a high quality product, you have to trust the architect and do as he says,’ explains Ivan using much stronger expletives.

    Most of the projects built for this client are situated in Ryblveka, on the outskirts of Moscow, but there was also a house in Antibes [a small town in Provence, France]. Here, the client bought a rundown villa, called ‘Segal’ [or ‘cricket’, in French]; designed and built by an Italian architect over 100 years ago. The building was in urgent need of restoration and Ivan took on the reconstruction. He increased the area of the villa by two thirds, up to 350 sqm [the key requirement was to meet the local building regulations, that is for the building area to be below 27% of the surrounding lands]. Originally, the villa consisted of a series of terraces and Ivan’s key move was to glaze them. He also designed a swimming pool, specifically positioned to have a view out to sea through the volume of the building. Segal is a second-line coastal property and the exit to the sea is marked with a memorial plaque to Claude Monet, as this is where the artist had painted a series of works depicting Antibes. ‘This story has influenced the appearance of the interior, where it was only possible to hang works by Claude Monet,’ explains the architect.

    Buried deep in Ivan’s archives is a project called ‘The Bastion of Resistance’. ‘Back then, together with Kostiya Vronskiy [architect Konstantin Vronskiy] we formulated a concept, in the form of a short text: ‘All his life, man builds himself walls. These very walls ruin his life but at the same time, he cannot live without them.’ 
  
    Allegoriaclly, the wall signifies the rules that inhibit our freedom. Everyone wants to be behind the wall, or rather, on the other side of it. 
  
    ‘Ghost’ is a manifestation of this concept. The south wall, consisting of clinker brick is almost completely impermeable. Integrated into this wall is a glass fragment that symbolises the beginning of its destruction and therefore freedom from rules and boundaries. 
  
    The opposite wall is almost entirely made of glass, with a small inset of a brick wall fragment, symbolising wreckage. This is a demonstration of the total disappearance of boundaries,’ explains Ivan about the concept.

    ‘Currently, the profession of the architect is stagnating, because most of the time, the architect has become ‘subservient’ to the builder. If the builder can negotiate directly with the client, there’s no point in working there. But if you have the ability to create a kingdom within a kingdom, so to speak on the building site, if you can organise the process in such a way that people will listen to you, then your presence is worthwhile. People only understand the language of money, so the key thing is to position yourself in such a way that the builders can only get paid through you. Then and only then will there be a reason for the architect to be there, and the violinist will indeed be necessary [‘The violinist is necessary’ is a reference to a Soviet dystopian sci-fi film, ‘Kin-dza-dza’ — one of Ivan’s favourites].’

    Almost all of his buildings use a Belgian tinted ‘en masse’ glass, called ‘Planibel Grey’ and it becomes apparent that this is one of the his favourite materials. ‘When the light shines onto it directly, this glass works like a one way mirror or, in other lighting conditions, it becomes almost invisible. Planibel Grey also has filtering properties and increases the sharpness of whatever is behind it. This way, the surroundings quite literally become clearer and brighter. The daily change and play between light and shadow, combined with this glass makes the house appear to be invisible, or ghost like. Due to the properties of this specialist glass, the villa changes from having weight and mass to losing it, from resembling a mirror to dissolving almost completely into its surroundings.’

    Ivan has a very specific attitude to space and that is always apparent in his projects. ‘The architect is always designing the hole within the bagel. Jeltovskiy had once said: ‘To draw a beautiful balustrade, you must draw the space between the balusters.’ We as architects, operate within orthogonal projections but they are nominal and perception always works best in perspective. I constantly aim to blur the boundaries between the internal and the external. 
  
    Also, it’s very important to see the project through to completion, to be its composer right up until the client moves in.’

    ‘I AM ALWAYS AGAINST ANY STANDARDISED PROJECTS.’

    For this ‘ideal’ client, Ivan has also built a villa called ‘Dinosaur’. He has a great naming approach — there’s also ‘Glabrous’, ‘Propylaeum’ and ‘ the Rugged’. ‘These names are significant because they always contain the key concept behind the project,’ says Ivan.

    Even if the villas get sold, they almost never get modified. The houses built by Ivan are objects in their own right, physical thought forms, manifestations of conceptual thinking. ‘The classic argument in architecture between the importance of form over function, the content and its container has no place to be, so long as the building is formulated by a strong, and fully crystallized concept,’ says Ivan. ‘If the form and the function are fully integrated into one another, the building will stand the test of time and remain unchanged, even as a museum. A great example of this is the Lenin mausoleum by architect Shusev. There is actually a competition running at the present moment to repurpose this mausoleum. However, the building is so laconic and so well established with its own distinct associations, that its very difficult to imagine it serving a different purpose, other than a museum about the creation of itself.’ Consequently, this is also the answer to the question of the industrialization of custom architectural projects. According to Ivan, these standardised projects can only ever be designed for what he calls short or temporary stays — hotels, hospitals, etc. But the standard project can never cater to individual needs. 
  
    ‘It’s a western idea to build individual projects on an industrial scale. By the way, the first American homes utilized soviet plywood, as it was very durable. Here in Russia, it was always the other way round. The commission came from the government, including the production of panels. First, they built five-storey homes, but then the buildings grew much taller. And so, the style of the masses was cultivated. Just like in ‘Kin-dza-dza’ — ‘the violinist is unnecessary’, the architect was only getting in the way, disrupting the work of the builders. After all, the builder always knows how to make the structure really durable. Here, the famous triad of Vitruvius — ‘utility, durability and beauty’ is broken. If you take one of these constituents away, the architecture loses its meaning because it ceases to be an art form,’ explains Ivan with a hint of irony.

    The architect thinks that even in our country, everyone can afford to live according to this rule. Everyone understands beauty, although they perceive it on more of an emotional level. It’s easy to assume that this ability is also dependent on your level of income but Ivan disagrees. He wisely points out, that even on a limited budget, the architect can still create something beautiful, functional and durable. And budget is therefore not the main deciding factor when it comes to choosing whether to work with an architect or not.

    ‘The role of the architect is to find the one and only appropriate solution in order for the client to build exactly what he needs. I like Phillipe Stark’s approach — cheap and even disposable objects should also be beautiful. I am against any standardised projects. Even though I do have a series of houses that look alike, they are similar in structure and use similar cladding materials, but they are still very different. We need to remember that we are not building the bagle itself here but the hole in the middle of the bagle, creating a space fit for living,’ says Ivan with conviction.

    GRADATION OF BUDGETS

    ‘You look at my villas and you think they are expensive? Not at all, it’s actually quite a modest budget.’ Ivan then proceeds to explain his three tiers. The first tier is the most expensive — these are buildings with structural concrete, architectural concrete and clinker brick. The cost for these, on average is around 4000 USD per sqm. This includes all infrastructure, services, interior finishes, installations and furniture. Time wise, these buildings take two to three years to complete. Tier two is a mix, where the lower storeys are masonry and the upper are timber frame, with glue laminated beams used for the floors. This idea of a structural mix dates back to our ancestors, the Russian merchants. They cost is 2000 USD per sqm and take one year to build.

    Lastly, tier thee is a full timber frame building. This is the most affordable option and only takes six months to complete. ‘If the house has two storeys, it becomes like a living organism, it moves and it can creak a little’ – remarks the architect about the particularities of timber frame houses. ‘But really, the materials themselves are not as important, they are a means to an end. You can even use compressed hay if you really want to. I had a small log cabin with a sauna in a place called Viyazma, that I built myself. This was at the beginning of my professional career, so it was in the style of Vasnetsov, traditionally Russian. It had a big, old fashioned, sloping roof with large overhangs and gables. Some workmen helped me with the main structure and then I did the rest myself. The roof appeared to be floating over a big flax field with blue flowers. One of the partition walls that I built was timber frame and this was the turning point — I understood what to do and started to build timber frame houses.’

    Even for the smallest budget, Ivan can offer a solution. ‘Like in that old joke,’ — he explains ‘where the changing room is across the road from the sauna. Except this is not a joke. Your whole plot of land is your home, so you can build several modules or separate rooms — the bedroom, the kitchen, the bathroom, the sauna can all be separated out into individual buildings. Only then do you truly begin to experience nature and can become one with it. This strategy, in the long run is less cost effective and also less energy efficient. However, if a full house is too much to handle all at once and you run the risk of having to freeze the works, it’s much better to split your task into manageable chunks.’

    SOLID WATER

    One of Ivan’s signature design details are his swimming pools. They are called ‘solid water’. This effect is achieved by lifting the water plane 25 cm above ground level and using simple transparent ledges. This way the water appears to be ‘solid’.

    The first ‘solid water’ pool was designed for a client in Spain at the beginning of 2000s. It was clad with black tiles and had acrylic ledges. ‘The black basin looks like a mirror. If you are swimming at night, it looks like you are swimming amongst the stars, in nature. The first pool like this was made for a villa called ‘Propylaeum’ on the outskirts of Moscow. Today, there are more than ten ‘solid water’ swimming pools and each one is positioned differently within the building. The very first one, is right in the centre, and due to the illusion created by the transparent ledges, the whole space appears to be flooded with water. In another villa, the pool is shifted away to the side, to make room for some chaise longues. ‘Ghost’ also has a ‘hard water’ swimming pool. Although there is a different illusion here, it looks like the swimming pool continues beyond the building and spills out onto the surrounding grounds. The structural glass strengthens the sensation of weightlessness and the absence of walls in this space. It appears as though the wooden ceiling is floating above the pool with no loadbearing elements underneath.

    Мы беседуем с Иваном Шалминым в здании “Почты России” на Варшавском шоссе. Из-за локдауна возникли трудности с покупкой фурнитуры, деталей интерьера, инженерной инфраструктуры, даже банальных светодиодов. Ивану нужны определенные лампочки, чтобы выстроить качественный свет на объекте, поэтому приходится заказывать через интернет. Таможенный пункт — не самое удобное место для интервью, зато можно узнать много интересного из рутинной сферы профессии. Мы разговариваем об индивидуальном строительстве вообще, переключаясь на конкретные примеры работ. В частности, на дом “Призрак”, построенный в этом году под Москвой.

    СЛОМАТЬ СТЕНЫ

    Дом “Призрак” — не первый дом, который Иван строит для одного заказчика. Иван даже сбился со счета: “вроде бы шестой”. Знакомство началось с того, что клиент хотел проконсультироваться по поводу кухни в строящемся доме, который был практически готов. Даже было сделано остекление. Закончилась консультация тем, что пришлось практически сломать три четверти объекта и все переделать. 
    
    “Ну а потом я построил для них еще несколько домов. У них такой стиль. Они строят. Живут три-четыре года и продают. Это такой идеальный клиент. Они практически не вмешиваются в творческий процесс. И главное, что мне нравится, они не боятся рисковать, если я предлагаю им какие-то новые идеи. С ними интересно работать, хотя они тоже иногда начинают “гайки закручивать”. На это есть эффективный ответ — я плохого не делаю, если хотите хорошую вещь, то делайте как архитектор говорит”, — рассказывает Иван, используя, конечно, в речи более крепкие выражения.

    В основном построенные объекты данного заказчика находятся на Рублевке, в Подмосковье, но есть дом и в Антибах [коммуна во Франции, в провинции Прованс]. Там была куплена полуразрушенная вилла “Сегаль” [в переводе — “сверчок”] итальянского архитектора. Этой вилле — более 100 лет. Иван делал реконструкцию. Площадь виллы он увеличил на две трети, до 350 квадратов [в этом процессе, главное, не превысить 27 процентов площади участка из-за кадастровых норм]. 
    
    Изначально вилла была представлена серией террас. Архитектор решил их застеклить. Во дворе построил бассейн, плавая в котором можно созерцать море сквозь тело дома. Дом находится на второй линии от моря. Выход к морю обозначен мемориальной табличкой Клода Моне. С этого места художник писал серию работ, посвященных Антибам. “Эта история повлияла на формирование облика интерьера, где могла быть представлена только живопись Моне”, — уточняет архитектор.

    В архивах архитектора фигурировал объект — “Бастион сопротивления”. “Тогда совместно с Костей Вронским [архитектор Константин Вронский] была сформулирована концепция в виде текста: “Всю свою жизнь человек строил себе стены, которые ему мешают, но без которых он не может жить”. Аллегорически стена — это те правила, которые не позволяют нам быть свободными. Все мечтают жить за стеной.

    В “Призраке” я воплотил этот манифест. Южная стена, выполненная в клинкерном кирпиче, — почти глухая, в нее интегрирован стеклянный фрагмент, символически обозначающий начало разрушения и переход к свободе от ограждений и правил.

    Противоположная же северная стена — практически вся стеклянная, в нее инсталлирована кирпичная плоскость, символизирующая обломки. Это демонстрация полного исчезновения преград”, — рассказывает Иван о концепции.

    “Профессия архитектор — сейчас — в стагнации. Архитектор находится “под строителями”. Если строитель может договориться напрямую с заказчиком — тебе там делать нечего. Если ты на объекте можешь создать государство в государстве, если можешь организовать процесс, чтобы тебя слушали, а люди понимают только язык денег, если ты сможешь поставить себя так, что только с твоего ведома идет оплата работ, то тогда — есть смысл. И скрипач нужен”.

    Практически на всех объектах архитектора используется бельгийское стекло “Планибель Грей”, тонированное в массе. Понятно, что это один из любимых материалов: “При определенной освещенности оно работает как черное зеркало [при попадании прямых солнечных лучей] или становится совершенно прозрачным. Стекло “включает” свойства защиты, типа фильтра. Увеличивает резкость и четкость, поэтому окружающая действительность видится ярче. Благодаря игре света и тени стекло позволяет дому становиться призраком, так как оно то набирает массу, то отпускает ее, трансформируясь в зеркало. Объем можно растворить в окружающей среде благодаря волшебным свойствам стекла”.

    У Ивана сформулировано конкретное отношение к пространству, которому он следует в своих проектах. “Архитектор всегда проектирует дырку от бублика. Жолтовский [архитектор Иван Жолтовский] говорил, чтобы нарисовать красивую балюстраду, нужно нарисовать воздух между балясинами, тогда у вас все получится. Мы оперируем ортогональными проекциями, но они условны. Восприятие точнее работает в перспективе. Я всегда стремлюсь стирать границы между внутренним и внешним.

    И важно доводить объект до конца — быть композитором и исполнителем до тех пор, пока люди не въехали”.

    “Я ПРОТИВНИК ЛЮБЫХ ТИПОВЫХ ПРОЕКТОВ”

    Для “идеального клиента” был построен и “Динозавр”, у Ивана все отлично с неймингом зданий. Есть еще “Лысые”, “Пропилеи”, “Шершавый”. Названия емкие, отражающие суть объектов, отмечает Иван.

    При этом даже если дома продаются, то вряд ли они будут подвергаться реконструкции. Хотя, конечно, такое бывает. Дома, построенные Иваном, это вещи-в-себе, определенные мыслеформы, выраженные концептуально. 
    
    “Спор в архитектуре — о первичности функции или формы, содержания или оболочки, не имеет смысла, если здание выполнено точно задуманной идее, — говорит Иван, — если функция и форма тождественно сопряжены, то и здание останется в неизменном виде, даже если уже как музей. К примеру, мавзолей архитектора Щусева. Сейчас объявлен конкурс на переосмысление функционального назначения мавзолея. Но это настолько лаконичное сооружение с устоявшимися ассоциациями, что трудно представить у него другое назначение. В принципе, оно может стать музеем, — о создании этого же мавзолея”. И это ответ на вопрос об индустриализации индивидуального строительства. 
    
    По мнению Ивана, “типовое” имеет значение для временного пребывания людей — отели, больницы, присутственные места, — но “типовое” не решает индивидуальных потребностей. “Это западная идея — возводить индивидуальные проекты индустриальным способом. Кстати, первые американские дома были построены из нашей советской фанеры, она обладала высокой прочностью. 
    
    У нас наоборот — исходили из государственного предложения, в частности производства панелей. И строили пятиэтажки, впоследствии — многоэтажки. Культивировался массовый стиль. И как в “Кин-Дза-Дза” — “скрипач не нужен”. Архитектор только мешает этим строителям. Они-то знают, как построить, чтобы крепко было. Тут нарушается триада Витрувия — польза, прочность, красота. Если что-то выбросить, то разрушится весь смысл архитектуры как искусства”, — рассуждает Иван, слегка иронизируя.

    Шалмин считает, что и в нашей стране каждый человек может позволить себе жить согласно этому правилу. Красоту понимают все, хотя воспринимают ее скорее эмоциями. На мои доводы про уровень жизни Иван справедливо замечает, что даже при ограниченном бюджете архитектор может сделать правильно, а значит, красиво, функционально и надежно. И бюджет в данном случае — не решающий фактор для работы с архитектором. 
    
    “Задача архитектора — найти единственное правильное решение, которое нужно человеку, чтобы построить именно то, что нужно ему. Мне нравится позиция Старка — дешевые, даже одноразовые вещи, должны быть красивые. Я противник любых типовых проектов. У меня есть серия похожих домов. Они похожи отделкой, внутренней структурой, но они все равно все разные. Не надо забывать, что мы строим не бублик, а дырку от бублика, обеспечиваем пространство жизнедеятельности”, — убеждает меня Иван.

    ГРАДАЦИЯ БЮДЖЕТОВ

    “Вы смотрите на мои виллы и думаете, что это стоит очень дорого. Вовсе нет, довольно скромный бюджет, на самом деле”, — предвосхищает Иван мой вопрос о верхнем уровне ценообразования. Архитектор классифицирует жилье на три вида. Дорогое — здания с железобетонным каркасом, с клинкерным кирпичом или с архитектурным бетоном. Бюджет подобных домов — в среднем — четыре тысячи долларов за квадрат. Это вместе с наполнением, с интерьером и инженерией. Стройка занимает по времени — два-три года. Другой вид бюджета — это “микс”: первый этаж — каменный, второй — каркасный. Перекрытия — из клееных деревянных балок. Такие дома выполнены в традициях нашего купечества. По стоимости — две тысячи долларов за квадрат. Строятся за год.

    Самое дешевое — каркасное строительство. По времени занимает — полгода. “Если дом двухэтажный, то он как живой организм, двигается, может поскрипывать, — отмечает Иван особенность каркасных конструкций. — А впрочем, материалы не важны — это только средства для достижения цели. Можно хоть прессованную солому использовать. У меня на Вязьме была дача, сам рубил баню. Это было в начале профессиональной деятельности. Баня была в стиле дома Васнецова, типа “Древняя Русь”, с большими свесами крыши, с фронтонами. Клети мне мужики срубили, окна и двери — я сам. Там было поле льна и над синими цветами виднелась летающая крыша. И после этой бани, когда я одну перегородку сделал каркасной, а не рубленой — я все понял и начал делать каркасники”. 
    
    На крайний случай и скромный бюджет у Ивана есть оптимальное решение. Как в анекдоте, уточняет Иван: “Баня, а через дорогу — раздевалка. Но это не шутка. Земля, участок — это и есть дом, поэтому можно построить отдельные здания в виде домов-комнат: спальня отдельно, кухня отдельно, санузел отдельно, баня отдельно. Только тогда происходит единение человека с природой. По затратам и энергопотерям — это не очень экономично, но если пока большой дом осилить сложно, потому что он превратится в долгострой, то тогда лучше — локальное освоение”, — детализирует Иван строительство дома по частям.

    ТВЕРДАЯ ВОДА
    
    У Ивана есть “фишка”. Он делает бассейны. Так называемая “твердая вода”. Этот эффект достигается благодаря верхнему переливу воды через прозрачные бортики, находящиеся выше уровня пола на 25 см. Когда вода выглядит как “твердая”. Первый бассейн Иван спроектировал для заказчика в Испании еще в начале двухтысячных. Проект выполнен в виде черной чаши с бортом из прозрачного акрила. “Черная чаша работает как зеркало, если ночью купаешься, кажется, что ты среди звезд, в природе, в небе”, — рассказывает Иван.
    
    Первый бассейн был сделан в Подмосковье, в “Пропилеях”. Сейчас таких бассейнов построено больше десяти. В объектах они размещены по­разному. В первом — ровно — по центру. Создавалась иллюзия, что пол залит водой, благодаря перспективе прозрачных бортиков. Был другой вариант — когда смещал бассейн к одной из стен, чтобы создать пространство для шезлонгов. 
    
    В “Призраке” тоже реализована идея “твердой воды”. Благодаря перспективе будет казаться, что бассейн продолжается на участке, словно выходит наружу сквозь стекло. Структурное остекление только усилит ощущение, что в интерьере нет наружных стен. Деревянный потолок над бассейном просто “висит в воздухе”, “без опор”.
