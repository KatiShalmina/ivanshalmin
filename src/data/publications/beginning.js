  tagline: 'Project author Ivan Shalmin: ‘I am a proponent of laconism. Yes, sometimes classics are well made, but they also require a certain lifestyle — by candlelight... Living in a museum? Trying to catch up with a bygone era? It’s possible. But why? Modern people live in the present, and they need something completely different. What exactly? Each of my projects is an attempt to answer this question.’',

    Ivan Shalmin believes that the most beautiful space is a project at its very beginning. The architect has a blank slate, and everything is still ahead.

    When work on a project is still ahead, when an apartment stands without a single partition, this, according to Ivan Shalmin, is the most exciting moment: everything is just beginning! The architect is convinced that there is nothing more beautiful than such a space — free and, by definition, open. Looking ahead, let’s say that the finished project we are going to discuss, that is, the definite result of the architect’s work, is arranged in such a way that it retains the features of its beginnings. And the most important feature is the free space. It is played up with the help of sliding partitions, reflective surfaces — glass and lacquered, panoramic windows, light grey walls and ceiling. The impression is completed by a huge photograph with a view of the city. ‘I always leave the space as open as possible,’ says Ivan Shalmin, ‘and it’s the same here. In my opinion, one bedroom and a studio is the ideal interior solution.’ 

    The owners requested two bedrooms. The architect planned the rooms so that one bedroom with an adjoining bathroom is located to the right of the entrance, and the second is at the far end of the apartment, behind the living room. 
    
    The kitchen, living room and dining room are designed as a single space; at the same time, the kitchen, made according to the architect’s original design, stretches along the wall and is practically indistinguishable as a kitchen. The sink is hidden, and the hob is seamlessly integrated into the worktop. The openness of the space is emphasised by smoky grey glass partitions that create deep ‘three-dimensional’ reflections, giving the impression that the space is dissolving.

    The living room has a TV area with a plasma screen and seven-channel sound system. The column covered with cowhide is actually a load-bearing structure.

    The hallway appears significantly larger thanks to the mirror and glass partitions. The main principle uniting the rooms is the conciseness of form and colour. The light grey colour of the walls and ceiling provides a backdrop against which warm, natural colours such as brown, red and beige look so striking.

    In contrast to the cold glass used in the wall finishes, Ivan Shalmin used warm materials, such as cork wood wall panels in the home cinema and cowhide covering the supporting structure. ‘I like to use materials in unusual ways,’ says the architect. ‘For example, this cork is a flooring material, but it looks even better on the walls [and, by the way, dampens unwanted sound vibrations in the home cinema area]. The panoramic photograph in the living room shows a view of Smolenskaya Embankment, which is actually nearby. If the floor were higher, the view would be roughly the same. So I ‘corrected’ the view from the window somewhat by hanging this photograph.’

    It remains to add that the furniture selected by the architect is classic minimalism. The MINOTTI sofa with light upholstery and light metal chairs designed by Harry Bertoia are ideal for a laconic interior: with such furniture, the space seems light, open and free.
