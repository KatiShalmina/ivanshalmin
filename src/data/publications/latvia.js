    The house has an area of 800 sqm and is built on a plot of 0.47 hectares. Nearby, on a plot of the same size, there is a regular park, also designed by Ivan Shalmin. The house in Marupe was built before The Ghost. Here, as in other projects, the architect uses techniques of visual transformation of space based on the principle of necessary sufficiency. There is a play of reflections on the facade, and the boundaries of the house are blurred by nature, with the glazing ‘letting in’ the interior but ‘not letting out’ the exterior, and a swimming pool with ‘solid’ water.

    The idea of ‘solid water’ was conceived 20 years ago for a project in Spain. The transparent side of the pool rises 20 cm above the floor level, so the water is also above the floor. Swimmers float ‘above the ground,’ have a better view of their surroundings, and can admire the nature outside the window. In clear weather, the ‘magic glass’ completely ‘disappears’ — it seems as if you are not indoors, but outside. The pool bowl is lined with dark tiles and illuminated with blue light. This makes the pool appear deeper and creates many beautiful reflections around it. You are not swimming in water, but in the starry sky and tree crowns — as if in a forest lake. The overflow channel is located next to the transparent side and is covered with stones.

    There are also several interesting items in this house — Ivan Shalmin always designs them specifically for his projects. For example, a lamp reminiscent of an antique organ. The phrase ‘architecture as frozen music’ has long become a hackneyed metaphor, but musical associations are bound to arise in anyone who sees this lamp. On the terraces and in the interiors behind the glass walls, you can see tables with luminous legs. For some projects, they were made of transparent acrylic, and for the house in Riga, they were made of acrylic imitating ice. In each case, Ivan individually selects the dimensions so that they are in proportion to the space. Then, depending on the task, he chooses materials to rest the tabletop on ‘fragile crystal’ or ‘suspend’ the table in the air, in other words, to break the laws of the existence of objects in space.

    The architect is constantly searching for design solutions that ‘break’ the laws of physics. Why? Building walls only to tear them down again — what a strange approach! ‘Architecture should be airy, it shouldn’t be restrictive,’ explains Ivan. ‘You can build ideal proportions, check everything against the golden ratio, but it will be boring. It is more interesting to create a new dynamic of space, right for each specific place — which you have felt, understood and summarised through architecture.’
